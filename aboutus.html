 <p>Tina Black</p>
<p> - My name is Tina Black and I will be going into the 11th grade at San Leandro High School. In my free time, I like to paint or write what I am feeling. I am currently in Girls Inc, Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program, and I also had an internship at the Oakland Police Department (OPD). When I get older, I want to work in the Criminal Justice Field.
